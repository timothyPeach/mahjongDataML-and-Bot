    "### Notes on the effectiveness of lookingForward() ...\n",
    "\n",
    "#### There is an amazing accident where once the amount of waits is maximized, it discards lone tiles and holds onto honors.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### I'm unsure whether this is good or bad, but it /could/ be very good if it doesn't go all in with single waits.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Also, there is definitely still a problem where it will value 7 9 where all the 8's are gone, which needs to be addressed.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Also also don't forget about lookingForward2.  Is probably worth finishing that one or redesigning lookingForward to be a recursive algorithm with a specified depth.  After this we could compare how long it takes, and also fix the random state and give the different depths the same problems and see how much improvement we get with each step versus how much additional time cost we incur.  I'm guessing that depth 1 or 2 are the only viable choices and that it probably is actually worth it to go 2 deep.  I think it's also beneficial in a lot of cases to annoy your opponents by using a lot of time to make your moves, because I am annoyed by such players sometimes, and when people are mad they don't think clearly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Oh very important to fix by making it go 2 deep instead of 1, is that it will actually differentiate between central tiles and terminals.  For example, a lone 5 sou is far more likely to yield a higher shanten than a lone 2 sou, because imagine the following 9 possible beneficial draws 1 sou thru 9 sou.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2 sou interacts with 1,2,3, and 4, (2 interacts with 4 tiles)  but 5 sou interacts with 3,4,5,6, and 7! 5 tiles!\n",
    "\n",
    "#### So this would seem to suggest 3,4,5,6,7 are better than 2,8 are better than 1,9, but isn't there a heirarchy within the central tiles as well?? This would involve looking VERY deep, but yes, 5s are the best for sure generally.  One interesting note here.  Suppose you have a couple lone tiles... a 3 sou and a 5 sou... and you're just waiting for your last double wait to come in.  Well, you don't want to throw the 5 sou, because then people can dodge you, safely throwing their 2 sou or 8 sou, knowing you do not have a -34- or -67- waiting on the 5."

    "### [1,2,7,22,22,22,28,28,45,46,49,90,90,90]\n",
    "\n",
    "#### So we've got a few melds and we're definitely not touching those. Those being 22,22,22 and 90,90,90.  I also like the pair because we have exactly one of those 28,28. The next best thing we have is the 45,46 double-sided wait.  It needs a 44 or a 47 to become a meld.  Next worst, we have 1,2, which can only become a meld by drawing a 3.  Next worst, we have a lone 7. If a 5,6,7,8, or 9 come in, it gets a little better because now it's 1-away from becoming a meld in some way, and 2 of those possibilities result in nice double waits... 6,7 or 7,8.  Far and away the worst tile in the hand is the lone 9.  Only 3 draws help it... 7,8, or 9, and none of those realities result in a nice double wait like the lone 7 might.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### I wouldn't go through all of this logic so explicitly.  I'd see some connected tiles, see the lone 9, see the lone 7, and decide the lone 9 was worst almost immediately, but yeah this (above) is more explicit.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### So we wanna be able to recognize when tiles are:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1) in melds.\n",
    "### 2) in waits for melds.\n",
    "### 3) alone and see what their waits are to be in waits for melds.\n",
    "\n",
    "### A concern I'm having is about series like 2,3,4,5.  There are a lot of ways to interpret this group of tiles. 2,3,4 is a meld. 3,4,5 is a meld.  if you don't have a pair, 2,3,4,5 is a pretty good way to wait for a pair in that if you draw a 2, you now have 2,2,3,4,5, and if you draw a 5, you now have 2,3,4,5,5. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Also, Imagine the following hand: [2,3,4,5,6,21,21,21,44,44,44,46,46,46] -- What do we say about it? Technically everything can be interpreted as being in a meld.  Sure, we can just discard whatever gives us tenpai, but there's a lot of choices here and they aren't at all equal. Let's re-envision the hand like this:\n",
    "### [2,3,4,5,6 -- meld,meld,meld] -- so we need a pair and a meld.  We also already have a meld.  Here's how I'd decide... Well... suppose you cut something like the 5. That way you'd have 2,3,4 as the last meld, and now all you need is a pair to complete your hand, so you have a lone 6 waiting on a final 6.  This is bad because there's only three of those left... Also, throwing a 5 is dangerous!  Instead, if you discard the 2, you have the following shape: 3,4,5,6, and you're waiting on either the 3 or the 6, and there's 3 of both!  This is more defensive, has more waits! just an all-around better move!\n",
    "\n",
    "### How the heck do we formalize this?...  Forget defense.  Even just the amount of waits... Even just interpreting melds flexibly...\n",
    "\n",
    "### Imagine a case like this: [1,2,3,7,8,9,21,21,21,24,26,28,44,45]...\n",
    "### We can easily say that the first 3 are melds... but are they? To be honest... at ANY time the first 2 melds could become a new source for waiting on pairs.  We currently have 3 melds (need 1 more) and no pairs (need 1 more.)  Our non-meld tiles are currently providing the following waits for melds: 24-26 waiting on 4 tiles (each 25), 26-28 waiting on 4 tiles (each 27), and then we have the -44,45- waiting on 8 tiles (each 43 and each 46.)  Now let's look at how these tiles wait on pairs.  Well, each tile is just waiting on the 3 other tiles identical to it, so no tile is any better than another here.  Since 24-26-28 takes up more space and achieves the same waits as -44,45-, we discard something like the 24, leaving the 26-28 waiting on four 27s.\n",
    "\n",
    "### So we ditch the 24.  Now we draw a 4. Our hand is like this: [1,2,3,4,7,8,9,21,21,21,26,28,44,45]\n",
    "\n",
    "### What the heck do we do now!?  We have to see the first meld completely differently now.  It's a potential source of a pair. it is providing 6 waits for a pair. That being said!!!, so are 26 and 28, but they are ALSO providing 4 waits for our meld! (all four 27s.)  But not so fast!!! Suppose we draw a 5 next turn! Now we have something that is providing 12 waits for a pair and 7 waits for a meld! (1,2,3,4,5 can create a usable pair with draws 1,2,4,and 5, and it can create a meld with draw 3 or 6.  How do we decide!?\n",
    "\n",
    "### This is actually kind of a conundrum and I think it relates to a bunch of things like, \"Will people fold if I can just get to tenpai even if it's with a single wait.\" and \"Do I have time to discard this single wait for the potential to get a really nice set of double waits\" and \"Do I just have to hope I draw a 27 because there's no time!?\" (and of course there's tiles people have discarded that we can see and we can factor those in, not a problem)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ignoring complicated considerations, if we just consider what our immediate waits are and preserve the structures that give us the maximum current waits... welll.... hmm... there's another problem...\n",
    "\n",
    "### We need 4 melds and 1 pair. Through my thousands of games, I have arrived at the following intuition about what is a fast way to make your hand... I'll sometimes say \"We need to keep stuff that helps us get melds more easily. You get pairs constantly.\"  And this is silly to say in this way when you think about it.  You have to get FOUR melds, and so why try so hard for a pair!?\n",
    "\n",
    "### There is actually one thing that makes it a concern, and that is that if you don't have a pair when you're in tenpai, you don't qualify for Pinfu, which is a bonus that generally increases hand value.  OTHER THAN THAT, it is very efficient to prioritize meld-acquisition over pair acquisition.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Safely I think we can just talk about meld-acquisition as a metric for how well a certain hand is doing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### I think this leads to the idea: \n",

    "### 1) Try looking at every possible version of your hand in terms of what the pair is, including the case where you have no pair.\n",
    "\n",
